From a certain point of view
Ringing the changes
Who's scruffy looking
All too easy
Impressive,
most impressive
Release your anger
There'll be another time
Don't give in to hate
City in the clouds
Asteroids do not concern me
I want that ship
Join us or die
Powerful ally
Great disturbance
Unlearn what you have learned
Away put your weapon
First catch 
You have your moments
Not afraid
You will be
Apology accepted
Put him in
Perfect hibernation
Bad feeling about this
You are reckless
It's a trap
Came here for the water
I was misinformed
As time goes by
Gross understatement 
Beautiful friendship
Second largest
You despise me
Only one I trust
Like any other man
Only more so
How nice
You remembered
Easy day to forget
They wore grey
You wore blue
Hill of beans
This crazy world
Here's looking at you,
You're getting on that plane
Maybe not today
Maybe not tomorrow
But soon
And for the rest of your life
Someday you'll understand
Always have Paris
Official documents
Exit visas
Reasonably sober
You better hurry
You'll miss that plane
Favoured sandwich
Orders are orders
Mutants in the middle
Wounded heart
Wounded knee
Bury my heart
Poor dead heart
Dance the apocalypse
Greeting the worlds end
Smiling at catastrophe
My friend the end
Face of Armageddon
Never compromise
Remember martyrs
We die
Broke my guitar
Buy you a new one
Four square for justice
Tell you where I stand
Tonight a comedian died
What happened
Everybody laugh
Roll on snare drum
Harsh and cruel
Curtains close
Nobody cares
Nobody but me

Judge me by my size
Look it up in the dictionary
Last night of the proms
Rotten egg
Laughing at you
Taking candy from a baby
